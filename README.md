# Location-Based Complaint System

This project implements a web application using Streamlit to create a system for submitting and managing location-based complaints. Users can submit complaints with details like subject, description, and optionally an image. The application utilizes geolocation to pinpoint the complaint's origin, enabling efficient tracking and response.

## Features

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive Streamlit interface for easy complaint submission.
* **Geolocation Support:** 
    * Automatically retrieves latitude and longitude from the entered address using the Geocoder library.
    * Allows manual entry of latitude and longitude for more precise location pinpointing.
* **Image Uploads:** Supports image uploads to provide visual context for complaints.
* **Database Storage:** Securely stores all submitted complaints in a SQLite database.
* **Complaint Visualization:** Displays a map of submitted complaints, enabling visual analysis of complaint hotspots.
* **Data Refresh:** Allows users to refresh the complaint list and map to view the latest submissions.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for invalid input and missing data.
